## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Loaded survey dataset of BINUSMAYA users.  
   - Removed irrelevant columns (e.g., semester, timestamp).  
   - Renamed survey questions into shorter and more consistent variable names.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Summarized response distributions.  
   - Visualized key variables (accessibility, UI satisfaction, performance, security, etc.).  
   - Explored relationships between features using correlation analysis.  

3. **Statistical Analysis**  
   - Applied reliability testing (e.g., Cronbach‚Äôs alpha) using `pingouin`.  
   - Conducted correlation analysis between user experience dimensions.  
   - Interpreted statistical significance of findings.  

4. **Visualization**  
   - Created bar plots, heatmaps, and other charts to represent survey responses.
